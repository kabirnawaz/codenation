    <p>
        Visual Studio Code has been a great text editor for the project as it has many extension that came in handy e.g. the live server extension helped me review any changes I made immediately. I used Codepen to check the functionality of small bits of CSS before putting them on the external stylecheet and gave me idea beforehand how would individual change look like. Trello made using Kanban project management technique much easier.

    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="responses">
    <p>
        The tools used were very appropriate in the following ways:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Visual Studio Code: It is a light and a very versatile editors. The extensions available are really handy. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Codepen: CodePen is a social development environment. At its heart, it allows you to write code in the browser, and see the results of it as you build. A useful and liberating online code editor for developers of any skill, and particularly empowering for people learning to code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Trello: It is an excellent way of implementing Kanban and even working on the project text based RPG it helped keeping track of the progress and issues. You can assign a particular task to someone as well which reminds them they have the responsibility.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="responses">
    <p>
        The strength of the project is that it is very simple and does what it is intended to do. In terms of agile development I think it qualifies for the minimum viable product and further features can be added to it.In terms of weakness, I think the colour scheme could used some improvement. If I had used CSS grid it would have looked much better. I do have plenty of ideas where there could be further improvement.

    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="responses">
    <p>
        The project is complete and working using HTML and CSS but I have a lot ideas that can be implemented using either HTML forms, CSS3 tools and most importantly javascript or going a step further using a framework of javascript e.g. React, would make the project much better. What can be done further is linking it to some projects on github as well. A light and dark mode can be added to the page as well. I will be working on it after the project even after the submission and I was planning since a while about making my portfoglio site and it gave me a good starting point.

    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="responses">
    <p>
        The solution fulfills the minimum viable product requirements as it does what it is intended to do and from this point a lot of features can be added on the MVP and github will help keep track if something goes wrong while adding a feature. The outcome is the answer of the questions mentioned in a easy to read manner.
