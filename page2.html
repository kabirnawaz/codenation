    <h3 class="queries">1.1 Purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
    <p class="responses">
            Impact of IT on modern business if daunting, if not possible but if we try to sum it up, it has two main effects, connection and automation.
            Connection:<br> 
            Today's businesses are connected more than ever, different parts of the business are connected as well as customers are connected in a much more personalised way than ever before. Head offices of these companies are well informed from the status of production in the manufacturing plants to the inventory of the warehouse and which employe did not check in today.
            Due to Data Analystics manufactures have much better idea of which products are in demand to rampup the production.
            In big manufacturing plants, warehouses and also in supermarkets, the staff can communicate each other using headsets.
            Automation:<br>
            Modern product is manufactured using advance automated actuators increasing the precision and accuracy of the product. With commercial 3D printing around the corner it is going to a whole new level.
            Thanks to Data Science machine learning today’s adverts are much more personalised to the user’s taste and in the flood of information provides users with only the information that the user is interested in. Small businesses hence can advertise in a way directly to their customer base, have automated email responses, can use chatbots for general queries and much more.

    <h3 class="queries"> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfullys</h3>
    <div class="responses">
    <p >
        The first critical decision in every digital project is which method to of development to use. It usually depends on the nature of the project.
        <h4>Waterfall:</h4>
        Waterfall is a linear process for design and development, where line items for creating the software are set and completed in order. Put succinctly, once one step is complete, the team moves onto the next step. The team typically can’t go back a step without starting over from the beginning of the process, as each step is contingent on the ones leading up to it.
        Waterfall is best for simple, unchanging projects. This method is akin to a relay race where every individual does their part, then passes the baton to the next person trying to cross the finish line.
        <ul>
            <li>It’s easy to use and manage: A Waterfall-organized project follows a predictable pattern, with no training necessary. This is a method that most design and development teams are familiar with. It also has a clearly defined timeline and project deliverables.</li>
            <li>Discipline is enforced: Every phase has a definitive start and end, and expectations for deadlines and quality are clear from the outset.</li>
            <li>It’s a well-documented approach: Documentation (project summaries, updates, etc.) are required during every phase, producing a high level of detail for stakeholders.</li>
            <li>There’s a cost to changing already completed work: Once a phase is complete, it is more time-consuming to make edits. Each phase stacks upon the next, creating a firm foundation that – if changed – is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to fix.</li>
            <li>It has a high degree of organization: All phases must be completed before delivery. This makes it even more important to test a minimum viable product for validation before the product’s release.</li>
            <li>Requirements can be inaccurate: The method is linear and necessitates highly accurate requirements upfront. However, regardless of how much understanding/ research stakeholders provide, it can be hard to agree on exactly what users want.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="subheadings">Kanban:</h4>
            Kanban is a low-structure agile framework that iteratively optimizes the workflow.
            This means that the current workflow is documented and tracked at each stage. The PM will set policies and measure efficiency by consistently managing and updating the workflow based on this documentation. The goal is to limit the amount of work in progress at any time and reduce the time it takes to go from an idea to a shippable feature.
            As teams work, the PM leads them to reflect on their current process and makes small incremental changes. Kanban typically works best for projects with rapidly changing requirements and when strict roles are not needed. Kanban can be used in conjunction with Scrum.
            Key Points of Kanban:
        <ul>
            <li>The method is easily understood by team members and stakeholders: The visual nature of Kanban makes it intuitive, allowing everyone to quickly align. It is important to keep it simple and policies explicit to help enforce shared understanding.</li>
            <li>It provides increased flexibility: It’s a fluid model with changing priorities and phase durations. Being able to easily shift project items around means that the team won’t spend time doing unnecessary work. But it also means it may not be clear when a task will be completed or how long a phase will last.</li>
            <li>The work in progress at any point is limited, creating bottlenecks: The emphasis is on finishing tasks and pulling things through the workflow to the finish line. When there is a limit to the number of items that can be worked in each phase, bottlenecks become clear and easier to address</li>
            <li>Design cycle time is minimized: “Just in time” delivery of the most top of mind functionality – with short workflows – limits the amount of time spent on any one project component. This reduces risk and increases the speed of incremental improvements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="subheadings">Scrum:</h4>
        Scrum is a structured and iterative model for agile software development particularly suited to manage complex projects with a high degree of uncertainty. Fixed length iterations, or “Sprints” with frequent prioritization and ongoing planning based on user feedback – are key to this method. Clear roles are defined with involvement and approval from stakeholders.
        <ul>
            <li>Often, there’s more project visibility: Scrum “ceremonies” keep the team on the same page, eliminating confusion and mitigating issues.</li>
            <li>There’s a high level of accountability: The approach involves shared, collaborative management of releases and ownership of code and design quality, with PMs not being solely responsible.</li>
            <li>It’s easy to accommodate change: Scrum spreads planning out over time, rather than doing all planning upfront. This provides a framework for uncertainty, with short sprints and constant feedback allowing the team to be nimble to shifting user or market needs.</li>
            <li>Teams can easily deal with uncertainty: Tackling certainty by features or bundles of features is more complex than, for example, mitigating all uncertainty upfront with Waterfall. There is reduced risk: Coding, testing, and feedback in smaller chunks allow the team to correct mistakes early on.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="subheadings">Skills:</h4>
        The skills required to complete any project can be divided into two parts, technical and non-technical. The technical skills literally depend on the nature of that project. If the project is related to embedded systems and IOT the skill set is completely different to that for any project for a developing a website. As an example we can for development of a website the skill set can be divided into three categories:
            <ol>
                <li>User Interface design</li>
                <li>Front-End Design</li>
                <li>Back-End Design</li>
            </ol>
            Ofcourse these general division can be divided into many sub-categories.
        The non-technical skills to complete any project are equally, if not more, important in completion of the project is communication, leadership, organization, negotiation, team management,time management, risk management, problem-solving, budget management, motivation, technical writing, adaptability, reporting skills, active listening, research skills, policy knowledge, conflict management etc. For further insight click <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/project-management-skills" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <h4 class="subheadings">Resources:</h4>
        <p>
            Resources required also vary on the project e.g. which project methodology is used and which software is required to implement. Hardware requirement vary as well e.g. any project on videogame development will require more computing power. Some requirement are generally common e.g. a good internet connection.

            <li>
                Define Your Goals:
                Goals give you direction for every choice from functionality to color palette. They can limit the scope of your project and provide criteria for measuring success. Who is your ideal audience? What features will best attract that audience? What is its principal purpose? What must your update schedule look like? Where’s the content coming from?
            </li>

            <li>
                Create a Site Map:
                Construct a catalog of everything you believe you’ll need on the website. From that list, prioritize the elements that are most crucial to serving your site’s purpose. Chart out what will lead where, how your site’s hierarchy will work. What links should be available from all pages? Creating this initial navigation structure will make it much easier to set stages of your project and track progress. It will also help you evenly distribute content creation duties among the available resources.</li>
            <li>
                Document the User Experience:
                Try to view the browsing experience from your visitors’ perspective. What frustrates you about your current setup? How can you change that to be more appealing? Explore your diagrammed project. The best websites are intuitive and communicate clearly. You can make or break your site before a single graphic is designed or page is built.
            </li>
            <li>
                List the Content and Functionality You Need:
                What will each page of your site look like, and what can you accomplish on each? What functionality do you envision each page having? List your intentions for each page, as well as for a universal navigation panel that should appear on all pages. Always have in mind providing the best user experience.

    <h3 class="queries"> 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
    <div class="responses">
    <p>
        In the digital world, the landscape can change quickly and unexpectedly. When the planning process recognizes the potential for change and allows for contingency planning, the probability of project success increases dramatically. Risk mitigation needs to be a key part of all project planning efforts and is especially critical for your digital projects. This means identifying and planning for potential risks as much as possible while also acknowledging that “We don’t know what we don’t know.”
        For example modern digital projects agile has revolutionized the software development world and for a good reason. With its characteristic rapid-fire iteration and continuous-feedback loops, agile has helped companies compress the length of time from development to release. What once took years now takes only months—even weeks but if companies don’t have the right conditions in place before they adopt agile, digital projects can go awry—at great cost. A pure agile approach may not be sufficient if there are too many moving parts: a technology architecture that isn’t decoupled, significant project dependencies (such as hard deadlines), or development processes that are not automated. In such situations, the risk level escalates and along with it, the potential for delay or failure.
        Through a hybrid approach called programmatic agile, companies that are not burdened with these preconditions can avoid such negative outcomes. This approach overlays traditional program management practices on agile methods. Programmatic agile, as part of a five-lever approach, helps companies take the risk out of digital projects and transition to modern applications, systems, and platforms deftly and flexibly. Once the levers take effect, risks abate, and delivery dependencies shrink, companies can relax the program management controls and shift to a pure agile approach and self-managing teams.

    <h3 class="queries">1.5  Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
    <div class="responses">
    <p>
        We can divide of selection and using of resources in 2 parts, IT systems and software.
        IT systems:
        It is vital to take due care when choosing new business IT solutions. Some of the key things you will have to consider when choosing any IT product are:
            <ul>
                <li>Functionality</li>
                <li>Compatibility</li>
                <li>Skills and support required</li>
                <li>Ability to scale up</li>
                <li>Integration</li>
                <li>Security</li>
                <li>Management and reporting capabilities</li>
            </ul>
        Selection of a IT system is subjective as businesses have several information systems in place. For Example:
        <ul>
            <li>Executive Support Systems</li>
            <li>Management Information Systems</li>
            <li>Decision support systems</li>
            <li>Knowledge management systems</li>
            <li>Transaction processing systems</li>
            <li>Office automation systems</li>
        </ul>
        See <a href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/choose-right-it-system-your-business" target="_blank">more</a>.
        Selection of software should take into consideration the software requirement of the project. It should also take into consideration the familiarity of team designated to the project with this particular software.

    <h3 class="queries">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h3>
    <div class="responses">
    <p>
        In my recent your projects with CodeNation I used Visual Studio Code as editor and the experience was amazing, the extensions of Visual Studio Code are amazing, the live server extension helped me looking at the changes I made to the webpages, there are a ton of extensions available for giving color to text. The versatility and lightweightness of the Visual Studio Code is nothing like I have experienced before.
        The GitHub workflow can be summarised by the “commit-pull-push” mantra.
        <ul>
           <li> Commit: Once you’ve saved your files, you need to commit them - this means the changes you have made to files in your repo will be saved as a version of the repo, and your changes are now ready to go up on GitHub (the online copy of the repository).</li>
        <li>Pull: Now, before you send your changes to Github, you need to pull, i.e. make sure you are completely up to date with the latest version of the online version of the files - other people could have been working on them even if you haven’t.</li>
        <li>Push: Once you are up to date, you can push your changes - at this point in time your local copy and the online copy of the files will be the same.</li>
        </ul>
        Github helped control the version and keep track of any bugs associated to the changes.
