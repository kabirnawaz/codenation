                The tools used were as following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Visual Studio Code: It is a light and a very versatile editors. The extensions available are really handy. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Codepen: CodePen is a social development environment. At its heart, it allows you to write code in the browser, and see the results of it as you build. A useful and liberating online code editor for developers of any skill, and particularly empowering for people learning to code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trello: It is an excellent way of implementing Kanban and even working on the project text based RPG it helped keeping track of the progress and issues. You can assign a particular task to someone as well which reminds them they have the responsibility.

            <p>
                There are plenty of ways to increase productivity when working on individual projects. Some are mentioned as following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Track and limit how much time you're spending on tasks.</li>
                    <li>Take regular breaks.</li>
                    <li>Set self-imposed deadlines.</li>
                    <li>Quit multitasking.</li>
                    <li>Give up on the illusion of perfection.</li>
                </ul>
                One other important way is to not treat your first release as your final realse, get a minimum viable product running as soon as possible and then add features to it.

                Next time I would have the place holders for the text and design the layout of the page before the text. I would assign a specific time for each time and have a self imposed deadline. Since this was my first experience of creating any webpage using HTML and CSS I think there are plenty of things that I would do differently for the second time. I would not put so much time on planning about the perfect webpage and having less time in the end to complete it.

            <p>
                To test this digital solution I would open the page in different browsers and see how it responds to them as support for the browsers is different. The other thing is opening all the possible links so see they are working in both browsers. Since the page is pretty much static so the issues that could arise are minimal. Since also the page doesn't take any input we don't need to worry about things like SQL injection but generally whenever testing a webpage or a digital solution the check list is as following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Functionality Testing</li>
                    <li>Usability testing</li>
                    <li>Interface testing</li>
                    <li>Compatibility testing</li>
                    <li>Performance testing</li>
                    <li>Security testing</li>
                </ul>
