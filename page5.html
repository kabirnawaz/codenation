            <p>
                I would like to start with the layout that is common in all pages. The title is on the top with a typewriter effect. It is followed by a navigation bar with active option in green and the rest in white.       
                The first page gives details about me. It has a picture of me on the top of Edinburgh Castle, from my trip to Edinburgh last year. Then it is followed by a biography which is basically a short introduction about me and some of my skills. It is followed by all of my formal Education and the final grades I got. The following sections are Interests and Hobbies and Contact being the last one.
                All the other pages have a similar layout but then contain the questions asked and the answer to them.

            <h3>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>

            <p>
                Due to the huge impact the internet has on the way we conduct trade and communicate with the world, it is essential nowadays for any business to have a functioning website. The creation of a website can be a fairly simple process but there are certain legal issues which should be borne in mind.
                One of the main legal rights created when a website is set up is that of copyright protection under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/contents">Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988</a>.The Act provides copyright protection to any literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, film or broadcast work that falls within the Act’s definition of originality when it was created. The creator of an original work gains exclusive rights for its use and distribution. The copyright protection is automatic; no formal registration of the copyrighted work is required.

                When a website is created copyright protection is likely to exist in relation to:
                <ul>
                    <li> the text of the site – can be protected as a literary work;</li>
                    <li>the pictures on the site – can be protected as either photographic or artistic work;</li>
                    <li>clips or vidanyeos on the site – can be protected as a film and or dramatic work.</li>
                </ul>
                To avoid being in trouble it is best to have these 5 practices:
                <ol>
                    <li>Assume It’s Protected</li>
                    <li>Read Click-Wrap Agreements</li>
                    <li>Remove Unauthorized Material</li>
                    <li>Investigate Claims Promptly</li>
                    <li>When in Doubt, Seek Permission</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them  </h3>

        <div class="responses">
            <p>
                Web users are a very diverse group of people. The internet spans the globe and allows people across ages and nations to communicate and interact. Each user brings unique perspectives, histories and opinions to the worldwide forum. There are, however, some differences between the users. These differences are not limited to just location or language differences. Some web users have lives that are complicated with lifelong disabilities. These extra challenges do not stop them from getting the benefits of being connected to the digital world.
                Accessibility is necessary and can be added to web functionality by means of tools, additional software or even special training. Having a disability might be an obstacle, but there are still plenty of ways to navigate the web.
                Some of the natural signs of aging, such as loss of sensory acuity, ability to process cognitive load and fine motor skills, all impact how older people interact with technology.
                Some things that developers can take into consideration while design with in regards with accessibility are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use alt tags</li>
                    <li>Create subtitles and transcripts</li>
                    <li>Put periods in abbreviations</li>
                    <li>Describe your links</li>
                    <li>Utilize color control</li>
                    <li>Get clickable</li>
                    <li>Keep your copy simple</li>
                </ul>

                Different formats have different implementation on the website.
                <h4>LOGO IMAGES</h4>
                <p> 
                You should use a .PNG (Portable Network Graphic) with a transparent background for your logo. It’s good to have a transparent background since your navigation bar may have a different color from the background of your logo. However, the ultimate file format for logos are .SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file extensions. These specialized files use actual geometry to display your logo. This means you resize the image to any size without any compression artifacts. The other benefit is that the image file size is very small. SVG files will keep your branding color and will have a transparent background. You may want to ask your logo designer if they have an SVG format you can use for the logo on your site.
                </p>
                <h4>WEB PAGE IMAGES</h4>
                <p>
                    We recommend using compressed .JPG, or also known as .JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), for images on your page’s content. It’s important to compress your .jpg images, since having  multiple high-resolution images will slow down your site to a crawl. You also want to crop the image to fit the page properly. It doesn’t help that your image is a highly compressed 8,000x8,000 pixels and you only need the image to be 300x300 pixels. The easiest way to compress images is to open your image in Photoshop and go to File -> Export -> Save For Web (Legacy) ->Beside Quality. Here there is a drop-down, select “High” in the preview window, check to see if you see any compression artifacts (if the image looks grainy), if it does have compression artifacts, go back to the drop down and select “Very High.” and click on “Save” to save the image in a location that is easy to remember. 
                </p>
                
                
                <h4>ANIMATED IMAGES</h4>
                <p>You may have noticed when surfing the web that you saw a small animation or video with no audio playing in a loop. Most of these animated images use the file format, .GIF (Graphics Interchange Format). Pronounced “jif” (however, if you pronounce it “gif,” we won’t judge you), this file format is extremely popular on social media and you may have seen your friends share those hilarious short memes of your favorite shows/movies. You can use this format to add small animations to your site. You want to make sure that the duration of the animation is short (keep it down to 5 seconds if possible), otherwise, you will start to slow down the site with a massive file size.
                </p>

                For the videos it is faster to load the video if it is uploaded on Youtube and the link is embedded in the page.
